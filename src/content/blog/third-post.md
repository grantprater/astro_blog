Another quote with no attribution sought out by me is “chemists get into it to make bombs and drugs, computer scientists get into it to hack things and make games”. One can see a clear parallel between these objectives violence and leisure, those two most human of pastimes. Bread and circuses for the more self-important among us. And so in that spirit I have embarked one could reasonably say belatedly on my own game making journey. I’ve tried out unity a few times with not a huge amount of enthusiasm. Unreal seems…interesting. But what I really wanted to do was actually make something that I would realistically make, and so I went to an expert on making things, pirate software, and his recommendations on how to get into game dev.

Probably not surprisingly, he suggested making a simple game first, an arcade game. One does not make their dream game as their first game and expect to finish it at all or within a reasonable amount of time certainly. Which is good because I’m not totally sure what my dream game is. And so, today I embarked on the first step of my quest in godot, an immediately more enjoyable interface and experience than unity for me. It feels much cleaner, and I even like what little I’ve seen so far of GDScript, their custom scripting language. I also installed Aseprite, considered the best pixel art program.

I then did about half of a tutorial, and intended to finish it but didn’t. I also intended to finish this piece of writing and umm, well I’m considering it finished now. Box checked, moving on :)
