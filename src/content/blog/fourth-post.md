Do we all find ourselves drawn to the apocalypse or is that a cultural quirk specific to my origins? Perhaps American, perhaps evangelical conservative, that particular brand that talks about young earth creationism and the moral degradation of modern society and the need to be distanced from it in order to maintain one’s holiness. I find myself dragging along dregs of that indoctrination, in my desire to be separate, to wipe it all away, to get to the point. I’m getting there. It’s probably a generally human tendency, more or less. The ability to conceptualize alternate histories and futures, branches off into another reality, leads naturally into one where we do not exist: the end of history (ours), the tidy last page of an engrossing and satisfying read.

This is supported by the fact that many many mythologies include apocalypses. The ultimate climax, whether cyclic or not (probably). I, as the enthusiastic consumer of my very own familial cultural content, came into contact with this little thing known as the christian end of days. It has several wonderful hooks, very dramatic. Cosmic-scale conflict, eternal imprisonment, burning, gnashing of teeth, etc. Gauche, but effective. Also, upon re-reading, quite silly in tone. Many numbers probably meant to be mysterious and up to interpretation. Dan Brown took his inspiration directly from the source.

Regardless, I do find myself wanting it to be over. All of it. Wanting a restart, or just a different option, or just, nothing. All the enthusiasm, the desire to understand, of childhood replaced by a creeping annoyance, a suspicion that in fact all there is is endless complexity of stupidity, waste, and abuse. The fascinating complexity of nature overshadowed by a human reality that is eminently disappointingly cyberpunk and increasingly fractured, bordering on psychosis. Any nudges individuals can make overshadowed by the churning seeming inevitability of “market forces” and such. The gaping maw of the maturing attention economy preparing to suck everything in with barely a belch of acknowledgment.

And it does feel inevitable, the end. Maybe it’s always felt inevitable, and there are many historical examples of doomsday prophecies and moments of extreme crisis. And certainly nothing lasts forever. Will we get another chance? Is there another level? Is this all there is? Does it matter? Obviously rationally operating as though this is all there is and trying to behave according to that would be the way to go. But one can hope for something else. Personally I want an explanation. An, “oh yes all those quirks and silly incentives leading to violent outcomes, perpetual cycles of destruction, and accelerating energy expenditure and waste on a universal scale, the winding of the clock ticking down to the final curtain call on everything? Pretty cool narrative device wasn’t it?” Ah yeah that makes sense, high drama, to be sure.

But yeah that’s all from me, thanks.
